# SoftwareTesterPoint Automation

This project contains automated tests for the SoftwareTesterPoint blog website. It uses Selenium WebDriver to perform navigation and interaction tests on the website's navigation bar.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html): Ensure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle website.
- [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/): Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers. Eclipse is an integrated development environment widely used for Java development.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi): Install Apache Maven, which is a build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. Maven simplifies the build process and manages project dependencies.
